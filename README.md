The **Logic Gate Simulator** is an interactive tool built with Pygame that allows users to visually create and simulate digital logic circuits. It provides a drag-and-drop interface where users can place logic gates, switches, LEDs, and connect them with wires to observe circuit behavior in real time.

## Features
- Drag-and-drop interface for adding logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.).
- Connect components using interactive wires.
- Real-time simulation of logic circuit behavior.
- Toggle switches to control circuit inputs.
- LEDs to display output states.
- Save and load circuit designs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hdaw1905/Logic_Gate_Simulator.git
cd Logic_Gate_Simulator
```

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the simulator using the following command:
```sh
python main.py
```

### Controls
- **Left Click**: Select and place components.
- **Right Click**: Delete components.
- **Drag**: Move components.
- **Connect Wires**: Click on a gate's output and then on another gate's input.
- **Toggle Switch**: Click on a switch to change its state.

## Future Improvements
- Implement flip-flops and sequential circuits.
- Add support for user-defined logic blocks.
- Improve UI with better animations and component selection.
- Export circuit diagrams as images or JSON files.
