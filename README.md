# Logic_Gate_Simulator
The Logic Gate Simulator is an interactive tool built with Pygame that allows users to visually create and simulate digital logic circuits. It provides a drag-and-drop interface where users can place logic gates, switches, LEDs, and connect them with wires to observe circuit behavior in real time.
